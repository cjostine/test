This is sub1/subsubB/default.

Every directory in the `proj' project has a file named `default'.

This line was added in the second commit (affecting all 7 files).

This bit was committed on trunk about an hour after an earlier change
to everyone else on branch B_SPLIT.  Afterwards, we'll finally branch
this file to B_SPLIT, but rooted in a revision that didn't exist at
the time the rest of B_SPLIT was created.

This change affects sub3/default and sub1/subsubB/default, on branch
B_SPLIT.  Note that the latter file did not even exist on this branch
until after some other files had had revisions committed on B_SPLIT.
